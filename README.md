# Welcome to the course for Data Intensive Science
This repository contains the materials for a six week course about data analysis, reproducibility, and open science. Right now the course is in its planning phase, where I collect and create materials that I want to use for the course. The course is for anyone who is interested in learning about reproducible data analysis and data intensive research. I'll try to create the material in such a way that anyone can learn to content self-paced on their own. However, this course will also be taught at [Heinrich Heine University](http://www.biologie.hhu.de) for master students in the biology major. I will try to allow other students as well, but right now I have no idea if the course will be accepted in other majors as well. If your a student interested in taking the class and you don't care about a transcript, your always welcome. Contact information and information about date and location can be found on our [lab website](http://www.synmikrobiologie.hhu.de).

## Syllabus
### Lecture
* What is Open Science and why is it important?
* What is Data Intensive Science all about?
* The reproducibility crisis
* GitHub and Python/R (including Jupyter, PyCharm, RStudio and RMarkdown)
* Some more lectures about data producing experiments (This would right now be biology focussed, one could try to get more professors involved and create parallel lecture session suited for different majors.)
* Statistic lectures (Descriptive first and later inferential)

### Practical Course
* Version Control with Git and GitHub
* Basic Python (Variables, Lists, Functions)
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Graphics (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh)
* Stats (Scipy, Statsmodels)
* Predictions (Scikit-Learn)
* Intro to R and R Markdown
