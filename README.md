# Welcome to the course for Data Intensive Science
This repository contains the materials for a full semester (15 weeks) course about data analysis, reproducibility, and open science. Right now the course is in its planning phase, where I collect and create materials that I want to use for the course. The course is for anyone who is interested in learning about reproducible data analysis and data intensive research. I'll try to create the material in such a way that anyone can learn the content self-paced on their own. However, this course will also be taught at [Heinrich Heine University](http://www.biologie.hhu.de) for all interested students of all majors. The course is, however, officially intended for biology master students, but I will try to allow other students as well. Right now I have no idea, if the course will be accepted in other majors as well, expect for cross-disciplinary classes. If your a student interested in taking the class and you don't care about a transcript, you're always welcome. Contact information and information about date and location can be found on our [lab website](http://www.synmikrobiologie.hhu.de/lehre.html).
